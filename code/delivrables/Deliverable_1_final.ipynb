    "## 1. Introduction & Problem Context\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.1 Motivation\n",
    "The French environmental agency ADEME has issued a call for innovative solutions to optimize\n",
    "delivery routes in multi-modal transportation networks, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas\n",
    "emissions and energy consumption. This project addresses that challenge by focusing on the **Vehicle\n",
    "Routing Problem (VRP)**, specifically the Capacitated variant with Time Windows constraints.\n",
    "Modern logistics operations—such as e-commerce deliveries (Amazon, DHL), pharmaceutical\n",
    "distribution, and food delivery services—must simultaneously manage:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiple delivery vehicles with limited capacity\n",
    "- Customer time-window constraints (e.g., \"delivery between 9 AM and 5 PM\")\n",
    "- Minimization of total travel distance/time and vehicle usage\n",
    "- Real-world traffic variations across different hours\n",
    "\n",
    "The CVRPTW represents this complex optimization challenge accurately, and solving it efficiently can\n",
    "significantly reduce operational costs and environmental impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2 Problem Classification\n",
    "We address the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW)**, which combines:\n",
    "1. Multiple heterogeneous vehicles starting and ending at a central depot\n",
    "2. Vehicle capacity constraints (weight/volume limitations)\n",
    "3. Time window constraints (delivery time slots per customer)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an extension of the foundational Vehicle Routing Problem introduced by Dantzig & Ramser\n",
    "(1959), enhanced with practical real-world constraints.\n",
